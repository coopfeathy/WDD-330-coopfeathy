      <p>
        &bull; The following are unavailable for variarle names: <br />abstract,
        await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue,
        debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends,
        false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements,
        import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null,
        package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super,
        switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof,
        var, volatile, void, while, with, yield
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Also avoid the following for variarle names: <br />undefined,
        NaN, Infinity
      </p>
      <p>&bull; let - allows you to reassign the value later</p>
      <p>
        &bull; const - cannot be reassigned later, but objects can be mutated
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; var - is the older version of 'let'. Var can overwrite any
        built-in methods by assignment, which is generally frowned upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Constant and variable names can start with any upper or
        lower-case letter, an underscore, _, or dollar character, $. They can
        also contain numbers, but cannot start with them
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Template literals use the backtick character, ` , to deliminate
        the string
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; The backtock, `, will also allow interpolation of JavaScript
        code. This means that a JavaScript expression can be inserted inside a
        string and the result will be displayed
      </p>
      <p>&bull; NaN is an error value that is short for "Not a Number"</p>
      <p>
        &bull; The spread operator can be used to flatten multi-dimensional
        arrays. Flattening an array involves removing all nested arrays so all
        the values are on the same level in the array
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; It's also possible to use the Array.from() method to convert a
        set into an array
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; A memory leak occurs when a program retains references to values
        that can no longer be accessed in its memory
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Maps are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value
        pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries'
        in other programming languages
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for
        writing anonymous functions in ES6
