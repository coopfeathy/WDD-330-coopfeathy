        <p>&bull; To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces</p>
        <p>&bull; Access the properties of an object using the dot notation</p>
        <p>&bull; To call an object's method use dot or bracket notation; parentheses need to be placed after the method name</p>
        <p>&bull; An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function</p>
        <p>&bull; Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different purposes; a solution to this problem is to use the object literal pattern to create a namespace for groups of related functions. This is done by creating an object literal that serves as the namespace, then adding any values as properties of that object, and any functions as methods</p>
        <p>&bull; JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation</p>
        <p>&bull; (g) The global property makes the pattern return all matches. By default, the pattern only looks for the first occurrence of a match</p>
        <p>&bull; (i) The ignoreCase property makes the pattern case-insensitive. By default, they are case sensitive</p>
        <p>&bull; (m) The multiline property makes the pattern multiline. By default, a pattern will stop at the end of a line</p>
        <p>&bull; The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a page. These methods will return a node object or a node list, which is an array-like object. These objects can then be assigned to a variable and be inspected or modified</p>
        <p>&bull; The document object has a createElement() method that takes a tag name as a parameter and returns that element</p>
        <p>&bull; While it may seem useful to be able to edit the styles of elements on the fly, it is much better practice to dynamically change the class of an element and keep the relevant styles for each class in a separate stylesheet</p>
        <p>&bull; Event listeners are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens</p>
