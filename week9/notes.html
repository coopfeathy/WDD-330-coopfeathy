        <p>&bull; Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>
        <p>&bull; The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</p>
        <p>&bull; Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM only makes sense in a browser environment.</p>
        <p>&bull; Global variables are actual properties of a global object.</p>
        <p>&bull; The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user's browser.</p>
        <p>&bull; The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.</p>
        <p>&bull; A new window can be opened using the window.open() method.</p>
        <p>&bull; The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.</p>
        <p>&bull; Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</p>
        <p>&bull; Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer.</p>
        <p>&bull; To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript's 'cookie jar', using the document.cookie property.</p>
        <p>&bull; To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie.</p>
        <p>&bull; By default, cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set.</p>
        <p>&bull; The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals.</p>
        <p>&bull; The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.</p>
        <p>&bull; The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</p>
        <p>&bull; The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user's exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.</p>
        <p>&bull; The list of APIs is constantly growing, and includes APIs for accessing a device's camera, uploading files, accessing the battery status, handling push notifications, building drag-and-drop functionality, creating 3D effects with WebGL, and many more!</p>
        <p>&bull; The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>&bull; A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</p>
